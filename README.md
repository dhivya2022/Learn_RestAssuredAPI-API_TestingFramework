# Learn_RestAssuredAPI-API_TestingFramework
Rest Assured API framework

Rest-Assured is a Java based DSL (Domain Specific Language) which is most commonly used to test out REST based services. 
Rest-Assured presents a great advantage because it supports multiple HTTP requests
and can validate and/or verify the responses of these requests.

In this Project , 
Webservices from 2 services providers (PayPal and Stripe) have been automated.

Stripe: https://stripe.com/en-in
PayPal: https://developer.paypal.com/home - Create PayPal business account for using APIs
